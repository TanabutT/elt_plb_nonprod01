# infra

This folder is intended for infrastructure-as-code (Terraform, Deployment Manager) and deployment scripts to create Cloud Composer environments, GCS buckets and BigQuery datasets.

It is intentionally left empty for now — add deployment templates when you are ready to provision environments.
